        <h3 class="h3n">What Is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
        <P class="meanin">
        A cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that relies on cryptography for security.

        You can help your client understand that cryptocurrency can be used like traditional fiat currencies such as U.S. dollars and euros, as an investment, and to pay for everyday goods and experiences.

        As of June 1, 2022, there are more than 19,684 digital currencies with a combined market capitalization of $1.31 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. The largest by far is Bitcoin, released in January 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.
        The early digital products were easy to replicate, which was an inherent challenge to digital currencies until Bitcoin was introduced with safety measures in place. Now the use of cryptography and blockchain technology ensures that cryptocurrencies are nearly impossible to counterfeit or double spend, despite being digital.

      <h3 class="h3n">Things you needs to know about cryptocurrency</h3>
      <P class="meanin">  
       <b>{1} How it works:</b> Cryptocurrency is like fiat or traditional currency because you can use it to buy items and services. It’s different, however, because it’s digital-only. One simple way to spend cryptocurrency at retailers and vendors is through gift cards purchased through platforms like Bitrefill. Among the retailers that accept cryptocurrency through the third-party app are Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN), Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY), Walmart Inc. (WMT), and Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK). <br>
    <b>{2} How to start using it:</b> You must create a crypto exchange account. You can purchase coins through an exchange such as Coinbase. You can buy crypto with traditional currency using debit cards or bank accounts. <br>
    <b>{3} How to store it:</b> Transfer it to a noncustodial crypto wallet to secure your funds. A wallet validates your transactions and keeps your secret private key information safe. <br>
    <b>{4} Where can you use it?</b> Crypto funds are always available anyplace in the world because they aren’t tied to a bank or a government. <br>
    <b>{5} How safe is it?</b> Cryptocurrency can be safer to use because you don’t need to provide personal information to a vendor, lessening the chances of identity theft or fraud.

     <h3 class="h3n">Cash vs. Stocks</h3>
     <p class="meanin">
    Investors deciding on whether to invest in stocks or hold cash will need to keep a close eye on interest rates. One of the downsides of holding cash is that the buying power of your money slowly deteriorates due to inflation. Right now, the rates being paid on savings accounts and Treasuries are not keeping pace with inflation.

    The 10-year Treasury rate as of Oct. 8, 2020, was 0.78%. Meanwhile, the inflation rate for the 12 months ending in August was 1.3%. One of the big issues for cash investors these days is that interest rates have trended lower for years and remains near historical lows.

    .....That said, below are some additional considerations for cash versus stocks in 2020 and beyond.
      <br>
    {1}Are company profits growing or stable? <br>Many may consider oil companies a great buy because their stock prices have fallen. But buyer beware—the market may not stabilize and improve as fast as some expect.
    <br>{2}Are the dividends currently being paid stable? <br>Dividends are a large portion of the total return you get on a stock. If a company has a solid dividend-paying history and a relatively low payout ratio, then you might consider buying it.
    <br>{3}Are stocks safe to own for the next five years given the current market conditions?<br> In other words, do you have enough conviction in the stock’s value or growth prospects to believe in its ability to weather the market’s volatility?
    <br>{4}The amount of money you are willing to invest in cash versus stocks will also be influenced by your risk tolerance and investing goals. Investors who need funds for emergencies or are saving for high-ticket purchases will want to invest more in cash. Investors with greater risk tolerance and longer-term horizons for investing can put more money toward stocks.
    <br><br>
    <b>Bottom Line</b> <br>
    Where the stock market or economy is headed, and at what pace, will vary based on the investment professional you follow. While the solid returns following the financial crisis might not be replicated anytime soon, the current interest rates are low and pushing investors away from cash.

    The Bottom Line
    The real estate industry is robust, with numerous career opportunities. This article names only a few of the many career paths currently available. Other real estate career opportunities include:
      </p>

      <h3 class="h3n">Agriculture</h3>
      <p class="meanin">
    Investing in farming can seem like a good strategic move. After all, whether the overall economy's in a recession or booming, people still have to eat. Because of this, many investors regard agriculture and farming investments as being recession-proof. Further, as the world's population increases, farming will play an increasingly important role in sustaining global societies. <br>
    <img id="crypt-img" src="../res-images/agriculture.jpg">
<br>
    That said, literally buying a farm isn't a feasible strategy for the average investor. Buying a farm can require a large capital commitment and the time and costs of operating or leasing a farm are often substantial. Fortunately, investors have many other means to gain exposure to the sector beyond sinking money into a farm.
    <br>
    The closest that an investor can get to owning a farm without actually doing so is by investing in a farming-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) which our company has formed alliance with, to bring huge profit to our investors. <br>
    These REITs typically purchase farmland and then lease it to farmers. Farmland REITs offer many benefits. For one thing, they provide much more diversification than buying a single farm, as they allow an investor to have interests in multiple farms across a wide geographic area.
<br>
    Farmland REITs also offer greater liquidity than does owning physical farmland, as shares in most of these REITs can be quickly sold on stock exchanges.
<br>
    And farmland REITs also decrease the amount of capital needed to invest in farmland, as a minimum investment is just the price of one REIT share. Investors also have access to an assortment of publicly-traded companies that operate in the farming sector. These companies range from those that directly grow and produce crops to those working in a variety of industries that support farmers. <br>
    One potential investment opportunity is in firms that plant, grow, and harvest crops. Many of these firms also engage in such supporting activities as distribution, processing, and packaging. Unfortunately, there are a limited number of publicly-traded crop production firms, which include Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (FDP), BIG MONEY Adecoagro S.A. (AGRO), and Cresud (CRESY).
<br>
<br>
<b>OIL and GAS</b> <br>
    The oil and gas industry is one of the largest sectors in the world in terms of dollar value, generating an estimated $5 trillion in global revenue as of 2022.
<br>
    Oil is crucial to the global economic framework, impacting everything from transportation to heating & electricity to industrial production & manufacturing.
    About Hydrocarbons
    Hydrocarbons make up crude oil and natural gas, which are naturally occurring substances found in rock in the earth's crust. These organic raw materials are created by the compression of the remains of plants and animals in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, limestone, and shale.
<br>
    The sedimentary rock itself is a product of deposits in ancient oceans and other bodies of water. As layers of sediment were deposited on the ocean floor, the decaying remains of plants and animals were integrated into the forming rock. The organic material eventually transforms into   oil and gas after being exposed to specific temperatures and pressure    ranges deep within the earth's crust.
<br>
    Oil and gas are less dense than water, so they migrate through porous sedimentary rock toward the earth's surface. When the hydrocarbons are trapped beneath less-porous cap rock, an oil and gas reservoir is formed. These reservoirs of oil and gas represent our sources of crude oil and natural gas. <br>
    Upstream
    Upstream businesses consist of companies involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas. These are the firms that search the world for reservoirs of the raw materials and then drill to extract that material. These companies are often known as "E&P" for "exploration and production." <br>
    <img id="crypt-img" src="../res-images/oil n gas.jpg">
<br>
    The upstream segment is characterized by high risks, high investment capital, extended duration as it takes time to locate and drill, as well as being technologically intensive. Virtually all cash flow and income statement line items of E&P companies are directly related to oil and gas production.
<br>
    E&P companies do not usually own their own drilling equipment or employ a drilling rig staff. Instead, they hire contract drilling companies to drill wells for them and the contract drilling companies generally charge for their services based on the amount of time they work for an E&P company. Drillers do not generate revenue that is tied directly to oil and gas production, as is the case for E&P companies. Once a well is drilled, various activities are involved in generating and maintaining its production over time. These activities are called well servicing and can include logging, cementing, casing, perforating, fracturing, and maintenance. Oil drilling and oil servicing thus represent two different business activities within the oil and gas industry. <br>
<br>    
    Midstream
    Midstream businesses are those that are focused on transportation. They are the ones responsible for moving the extracted raw materials to refineries to process the oil and gas. Midstream companies are characterized by shipping, trucking, pipelines, and storing raw materials.
<br>
    The midstream segment is also marked by high regulation, particularly on pipeline transmission, and low capital risk. The segment is also naturally dependent on the success of upstream firms.
<br>
    Downstream
    Downstream businesses are the refineries and gas stations. Refineries are the companies responsible for removing impurities and converting the oil and gas to products for the general public, such as gasoline, jet fuel, heating oil, and asphalt. Gas stations are where consumers fuel up at the pump.
