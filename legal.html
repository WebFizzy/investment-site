          <h1>Risks of Digital Assets</h1>
          <p>Please note that all transactions involving digital assets such as BIG MONEY Cash, and Ether involve substantial risks. You should therefore carefully consider whether using our Services is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to hold digital assets, you should be aware that the price or value of a digital asset can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Past performance is not an indicator of future performance. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any loss of your digital asset, resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of private keys outside our control.

          We are not responsible for any digital asset market and we make no representations or warranties concerning the real or perceived value of digital assets as denominated in any quoted currency. Although we may provide historical and/or real-time data regarding the price of digital assets, we make no representations regarding the quality, suitability, truth, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of such data, and you should not rely on such data for any reason whatsoever. You understand and agree that the value of digital assets can be volatile, and we are not in any way responsible or liable for any losses you may incur by using or transferring digital assets in connection with our Services.
          
          We do not provide investment advice and any content contained on the Site should not be considered as a substitute for tailored investment advice. The contents of our Site and the Services should not be used as a basis for making investment decisions.</p>
